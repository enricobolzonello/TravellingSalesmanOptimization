Repository containing the project developed during the Operations Research 2 course in the academic year 2023/24. 

The aim of the course is to explore different approaches for solving the famous Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), ranging from very approximate solutions with heuristic algorithms down to exact methods employing CPLEX MIP solver. 

## üíª Requirements 
Install the following libraries to build the C program:
*   **gnu make**, v.3.81
*   **gnuplot**, v6.0
*   **IBM ILOG CPLEX**, v22.11
*   **cmocka**, v1.1.7 (optional)

For the profiling, install requirements with ```pip install scripts/requirements.txt```. 

> [!WARNING]
> Works only on Linux and MacOS

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Once the repo is cloned, go to the folder and run ```make```. Once it has finished, the executable will be located in ```make/bin```.

To see the full list of commands, run 
```
make/bin/tsp --help
```

### Automated Profiling
To run profiling run:
```
python scripts/compare_algs.py {config file}
```
where ```config file``` is a configuration file in TOML format (for an example, see the [TOML template](/scripts/configs/template.toml)). This will create a .csv file in ```/results``` with times for each algorithm and each dataset.

Once done, run the profiling with:
```
python scripts/perfprof.py results/{filename}.csv results/{outputfile}.pdf
```

## üì∫ Implemented Algorithms
